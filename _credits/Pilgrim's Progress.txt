- Mario/Demo only, other characters might break the game
- NO CAPES ALLOWED
- If raocow eventually plays this, please change enemies into Demo universe adjacent ones, otherwise it's basically vanilla
- If things have broken, feel free to let me know how to fix it

Screen 9: Black Tunnel
Music: N/A
- First screen, added later because oops
- A seemingly short black tunnel you just go right to enter the level (for shock value probably)
- Intentional Black Background and No Music

Screen 0: The Underwhere, Entrance
Music: Super Paper Mario - The Underwhere (https://youtu.be/j9jk9AOcn6k)
- Friendly NPCs to chat with
- A clear attempt copy recreation of Super Paper Mario's 7-1

Screen 1: The Underwhere, Part 2
Music: Super Paper Mario - The Underwhere (https://youtu.be/j9jk9AOcn6k)
- Screen 2 of SPM 7-1, but very short
- Meant to be a transition area

Screen 2: Slough of Despond
Music: EarthBound - Deep Darkness (https://youtu.be/g_qJiMc-9i8)
- Starts out as 7-1's pipe room, but heads into a water based level

Screen 3: Difficulty Hill
Music: Super Mario 3D World - Lava Rock Lair (https://youtu.be/1YMQl2GJfBM)
- Level has wrap-around horizontally
- Could not figure out how to make ladder appear after climbing through the quicksand, so clear pipe in its place as a shortcut

Screen 4: The Overthere Stair, but its Under Maintenance, so just use the Elevator
Music: Super Paper Mario - The Overthere (https://youtu.be/TW7cQJBxr4k)
- Mild carbon copy of SPM 7-3
- Checkpoint, as it marks the half-way point

Screen 5: Overthere Elevator Climb
Music: Mario Strikers Charged - Pause Menu (https://youtu.be/51klt2lnUzs)
- Makes specific mentions of higher floors being under construction/revamp (Palace Beautiful, Vanity Fair, Valley of the Shadow of Death)

Screen 6: Doubting Castle
Music: Wario Land: Shake It! - Airytale Castle (https://youtu.be/-HmlHOKmmMA)
- The main trick is the exit is close by
- The key is a red herring

Screen 7: Celestial City
Music: Wario Land: Shake It! - Airytale Castle (https://youtu.be/-HmlHOKmmMA)
- Homage to the Western Air Temple from Avatar: The Last Airbender
- Final screen before the end

Screen 8: Gates of the Overthere
Music: Super Paper Mario - Overthere Shrine (https://youtu.be/rpkKJKggKBE)
- End of the Level
